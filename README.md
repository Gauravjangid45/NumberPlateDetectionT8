# NumberPlateDetectionT8
This is one of the great project assigned as a task by Mr. Vimal Daga sir from Linux World Informatics Pvt. Ltd. under Summer Program 2021.
Here I have used concept of Computer Vision to perform all the preprocessing on the image to detect the number plate of vehicle, and also the pytesseract to convert the image into text.
Later on an API is been used to get the details of Vehicle, which gives output in the form of JSON.  And then these details are printed in the output box of the web.
